# Hackers guide to Neural Network in Python

This is a repository of code examples of [Andrej Karpathy's famous NN guide](http://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/) converted into Python. I haven't been using JS for a while so I thought converting them into python will help me understand the concepts better and it did! Hope you'll find it useful too.
